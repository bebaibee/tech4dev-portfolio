  In Yoruba, <strong>"Ikoko Maami"</strong> means Mother's Pot which simply reflects the love and care of a mother and as such, the business aims at giving back to women.<strong>"Ikoko Maami"</strong> is a profit-for-purpose restaurant where 50 per cent of profits are donated to giving experience, trainings, employment and business support(tools) locally to young disadvantaged girls and women. Customers can even decide where they would like their money to go to. Our business covers aspects of Economic Growth and Decent Work, Gender Equality and Zero Hunger.<br><br>
  The menu is a celebration of Yoruba cuisine and culture.The love for <strong>"Mama Put"</strong> and the right taste for local meals as well as the need to improve the lives of women and young girls who have no formal education, pushed the idea into creating a restaurant that brings food to the people familiar with yoruba cuisine in a conducive environment. As well as providing decent work and business opportunity to underserved women. This gives the women and young girls independence, self-worth and the ability to provide for themselves and their families.<br><br>
	We cover mainly yoruba food for people who love and enjoy yoruba meals, like "amala and gbegiri", "rice and obe ata", "asaro" etc. we are here for our <strong>"Mama Put"</strong> lovers too. <br><br>
  <strong>"Ikoko Maami"</strong>also offers catering services to individual and corporate clientele within Lagos State. </article><br>
